# CareLoop: AI + Human-in-the-Loop Health Assessment

CareLoop is an interactive health assistant that lets patients report symptoms visually (by clicking body parts) and describe issues. An AI agent analyzes the inputs, asks clarifying questions, and forms a preliminary hypothesis — which is always **validated by a human doctor** before being shared back with the patient. This ensures trust, safety, and effective use of AI in healthcare.

## 💡 What We Built
- **Problem:** Patients experiencing ad-hoc symptoms often don’t know whether to seek urgent care or wait. Online search is unreliable and anxiety-inducing.  
- **Solution:** An AI-powered triage assistant with human-in-the-loop:
  1. Patients click on a body diagram to report issues.
  2. AI asks clarifying questions and analyzes patterns.
  3. AI provides a preliminary assessment.
  4. A human doctor reviews, verifies, and confirms with the patient.
- **Impact:** Faster triage, reduced unnecessary ER visits, and stronger trust in AI health systems.
